This repository contains all of the ros nodes and algorithms required to run the "brain" of the model.


For image processing algorithm testing, modify the vision package. The vision package acts as a library and the headers are exposed so that other ros packages may use the vision code.

The vision package also creates its own executables so that the libraries can be tested without having to run ros nodes.

The executables are contained in devel/lib/vision
It is recommended that you store test footage in a folder exterrnal to the ROS workspace so that removing devel does not necessitate redownloading.


This repository should build in the VM with no problems.

In the ~ directory, run:

> hg clone https://bitbucket.org/utra-art/art-meta

Also: if you choose to put the new meta workspace in a different directory from the original art_ws, then you need to also edit your ~/.bashrc to source ~/<new_ws_directory>/devel/setup.bash instead  of the old path, otherwise you will *tear your hair out for hours* trying to figure out why the changes that you make to your ros nodes don't show up when you rosrun them.

> cd art-meta

> catkin_make
